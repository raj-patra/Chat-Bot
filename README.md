#Nicole - The Chat bot

Nicole is an intelligent chatbot made out of AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) files.

There are two codes in the Repository-
One runs in the Python console, taking prompts from the user and providing with witty replies based on its brain.
The other is a GUI made with Tkinter for python, an easy to use interface which gives a chat room experience.
